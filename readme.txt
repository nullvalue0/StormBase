StormBase v0.1 beta

This release of StormBase does not have an sysop online editor for 
bases or messages. You will have to have Microsoft Access 2000 (or 
newer) in order to edit the database manually. The only table you
should have to alter initially will be the "Bases" table. You can
blow away the default bases and add your own.

Please report any feature requests or bugs to me asap. thanks!
