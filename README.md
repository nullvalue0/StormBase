# StormBase
StormBase is a message base BBS door, using my door kit - StormDoor. Intended for use with front ends that don't have their own message base features, such as Gamesrv. 

## History
I started working on this around 2004 to add a message base to the BBSmates Gamesrv BBS. This was developed in Visual Basic 6.0. I recently discovered a backup of this old code. I am releasing it to GitHub mainly so I never lose it again, but anyone is free to do whatever they want with it.

## Setup
This release of StormBase does not have an sysop online editor for bases or messages. You will have to have Microsoft Access 2000 (or newer) in order to edit the database manually. The only table you should have to alter initially will be the "Bases" table. You can blow away the default bases and add your own.
